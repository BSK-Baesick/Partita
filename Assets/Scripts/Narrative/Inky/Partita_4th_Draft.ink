Long overdue. 

He waits for you, for some kind of strange permission, and you give it by stretching bow across silver string. 

The world, their world, brightens against the night and you see heavy smiles turn light. 

The woman laughs.

The man laughs.

You laugh.

You play on against the storm outside and long into the eveing. 

In this reprieve, music mutes the outside air.

You play until the storm recedes.

They aren't.

As the bus pulls up and you stumble out into the street, the stark absence of them cuts you deeper than any winter wind.
