Weary eyes pierce through glaring snow, as your feet touch soft powder. An ancient woman sits, alert, back pressed against concrete wall. In her arms she cradles a rifle, trained delicately on your approach.

After a moment of wariness, the woman's shifting demeanor seems genuine. You help her gather firewood, and as you reach for a pile of kindling, a thin red envelope catches your eye amidst the shrubbery.

You know that this was meant for you.

You open it, and familiar handwriting sends warmth wrapping round your body.

The road is long and monotonous. Grey snow falls against a dull backdrop. Faint hints of color splash amidst the skyline and before you know it, the ride is over.

As you press on to sleeted ground, a man waits nearby. Older, but not elder, he's frail if not determined in demeanor. Grey eyes seem to glance towards you, then behind you to the closing door.

Embarrassed by her own honesty, she turns away to stare against the horizon. The rage is still there, resting behind the eyes, but resting none-the-less.
+ "I get it."
VERA: Fuck off Shoestring.
    ++ "That one's not even a pun."

Eventually, you settle into silence against the hum of the engine, your gazes drawn to the endless white horizon. Out of the corner of your eye, you see her soften at the sight. She's still a kid, tapping gently at the drum on her side.
+Play alongside her.
You draw bow to string, expecting some grand rebuke. She offers nothing more than a petty scowl and a louder beat. You slowly start to dance against each other's sound, watching as the world you both once knew floats by on a sea of snow. It's still beautiful. You think you see her smile, maybe. Probably not though. 
+Sit in silence.
She taps against the snare and the side of the bus, matching wardrum rhythm to the engine below. She continues for the rest of the trip, fiery eyes gazing out over a sea of snow.
- Eventually, the bus starts to slow against the final bend of the road. Her fire returns as she pulls out a map from her coat pocket, scouring dogears and scribbled notes. This is your stop. Not hers. You weigh the weight of truth.

You step back onto solid ground once more as the doors behind you hiss to a close. You turn back to face the window, where you're met by the sight of two middle fingers and two fiery eyes. She offers one last smirk as the bus curves around the trees and back out onto the empty road. Nothing to be done. You turn back to your own journey.->Chapter4

You step back onto solid ground once more as the doors behind him hiss to a close. As you turn back to face the window, you're met by the sound of a cocking rifle from back inside the bus.
VERA: "ALRIGHT FUCKBUCKET! LET'S TURN THIS STEEL TURD AROUND. WE'RE HEADING NORTH BABY!"
Grimacing as the driver's desperate eyes catch your own, you watch as the bus slowly reverses back the way it came.
From a nearby window, a terrifying child offers a friendly wink before the bus disappears behind the bend.
Nothing to be done. You turn back to your own journey.

/ART Bustop 3 AND PROTAG2
As evening settles in, you cross the road to the next weary stop. It's empty for now. A strange, lonely reprieve from the norms of peculiar company. You scour the surroundings, until a familiar red hue pops out from the stump of a nearby tree. Warmth rushes through you as you pull the letter from it's hidey hole.

PASCHA: "Drugs?"

/ART PASCHA appears

    You rise with a start against the sudden new presence. Turning back towards the stop, you see a figure where there was none before. Sharp eyes. Hair too soft. Skin too shiny. A perfect smile: charming and yet full of grit. They are, in a word, "eccentric".
    + "Nothing that interesting."
    PASCHA: "I beg to differ. In fact I'd be more interested if it wasn't drugs. So now, I am thus, "more interested"."
    + "Just a letter."
    PASCHA: "Well that is much more interesting."
    - They siddle slowly towards you.
    PASCHA: "Albeit, I wouldn't say no to drugs. I am desperately bored."
    Sharp eyes turn down towards the envelope in your hands.
    PASCHA: "Read it to me?"
    + "No."
    Sharp eyes turn round as they plead with you.
    PASCHA: "Pleaaaase?"
    ->AreYouHigh
    + "Why?"
    PASCHA: "I told you, I'm bored.

++ "Are you high?"
        PASCHA: "I fucking wish, my dear. Now come, you sweet summer thing. Why not spill secrets with a stranger?

            +++ "..."
            PASCHA: "Fine. I'll start." 
            They raise a dramatic hand against their forehead.

PASCHA: "Swear it on my grave. Dragged there by stupid stupid queer love for stupid stupid queers."
+ "How?"
PASCHA: "Stupid, stupid queer love for stupid stupid queers."
+ "How dramatic."
PASCHA: "Death is pure drama. But it's love that pulls me there. Stupid, stupid queer love for stupid stupid queers."
- They twirl towards you. Honest eyes stare into your soul.
PASCHA: "I get half a day's walk from the border and my fuckwit of a lover gets caught in Moscow. Now me and my stupid bleeding heart are stuck racing back into the dark."
They sigh.
PASCHA: "Anyway. Your turn!"
Before you can respond, they slip the letter from your grasp, laughing as they race back into the snow.
+Chase them.
You lumber through thick powder, but they dash away with a tedious ease, tearing open the envelope as they bound through the snow.
+Let them go.
They settle a few feet away in the snow. Grounding themselves for some kind of performance and they rip the envelope open.

-PASCHA: "I'm about to cross in Abkhaz1a and I've just realised I've never heard back from you. It makes sense of course, me traveling ahead and all. But it's scary, terrifying, to never really know where you are. I w1sh I'd never asked you to stay in Moscow. I wish we'd left when you said we should. I'm 3orry. Please let me say that in person. Please let me meet you at the next stop. Please let us cross the rest together. I love you. I love you. I love you."

    PASCHA: "Huh. That was easy."
    
    You sigh as you rip open the envelope, eyes greeting familiar, comforting handwriting.

    They sigh and stare at you with sad eyes.
    PASCHA: "Truly, we are kin. Bound by dumb love. You for freedom, and I for the fire. Guess I should've chosen a smarter lover, one not fuckwitted enough to get caught in Moscow of all places."
    + "I'm sorry."
    PASCHA: "Don't be. Jealousy among outcasts is a tedious thing. I am happy for you."
    They smile.
    PASCHA: "Truly."
    + "You don't owe them your life."
    PASCHA: "Oh but I do. Love's a fickle Mistress like that. Take comfort that we'll never truly die, I suppose. Long as they keep breeding, we'll be being bred. Kind of Godlike like that, aren't we?"
    They chuckle.
    - PASCHA: "Play a dirge with me. Some battle song to feed me fake courage?"
    + "I won't entertain a deathwish."
    PASCHA: "You are a cruel thing, my dear."
    Pascha plays alone. You see faint tears catching moonlight. They keep you awake until the grasp of exhaustion drags you both into slumber.
    ->Chapter4Epilogue
    + "Of course."
    PASCHA: "Then let's dance the night away."
    ->PaschaDuet
    
    =PaschaDuet
    And so you dance for hours upon hours. You twist angels in the fresh laid snow and music in the clear moon sky. It's no dirge, no battle song, but rather seems a ballad for all the queers that ever did queer. You could swear for a moment you felt the earth shift, before evening takes hold and you both collapse harmlessly into a long night's sleep.
    ->Chapter4Epilogue
    
=Chapter4Epilogue
Their bus arriving earlier than your own, your momentary companion rises early against the dawn. Their skin is still too shiny and their hair is still too soft. At least their sharp eyes seem somewhat weary. They smile as you wake to bid them farewell.

+ {TakeTheRifle and not GiveVeraRifle} "Here you go Rambo." Give them the rifle.
They take the rifle with both hands, toying with it for a moment before nodding graciously and strapping it to their back.
PASCHA: "S'pose I'll be getting more in touch with my Masculine side."
+ "Don't die stupid."
PASCHA: "Oofy doofy. That is a tall order my dear."
They chuckle.
PASCHA: "I'll try."
+ "Good luck."
PASCHA: "I'm sure your well wishings will make all the difference my dear.
They chuckle, warmly.

- As their bus presses round the corner, they step off the platform and into the snow leading to the roadside.

+ "I think I met your father."
They don't stop walking, but a voice responds.
PASCHA: Truly a real cunt of a man.
    ++ "I've never seen so much regret."
    They stop. 
    The bus waits. 
    They wait.
    PASCHA: "Thank-you."
    And press forth once more, rising on steel steps and disappearing behind glass doors.

    ++ "Yeah..."

+Let them go.

-And they press on through the snow.

Up the stairs.

Disappearing behind glass doors.

An hour later, your bus arrives: a quiet, lonely shuttle to the edge of the Union's remains. 

Abkhazia awaits.

And so do they.
->Chapter5

=Chapter5
/Riding the bus
Abkhazia rolls in on the horizon. The Dead Sea breeze catches your nostrils with a sting that rights you alert and upright. Your stare out down the road ahead. They should be here.

They should.

They will.

They aren't.

As the bus pulls up and you stumble out into the street, the stark absence of them cuts you deeper than any winter wind.

+Look for anyone. Anyone at all.
Your eyes dash out against the cold horizon, marked only by the bus stop before you. They dart to and from every corner of the world, before resting on a figure hidden behind a bus stop pillar.
+Call out their name.
You cry out into the wind. You could swear it picks up a chill in response. Silence.
Then.
"Hello?"

Your eyes flash towards the source of the voice, a figure resting behind a pillar of the bus stop.

- Your smile widens as you race towards the stop. 

The figure emerges.

You pause in your tracks.

It's not them.

ZURAB: "Ah. You're not looking for me, are you?"

An old man, not so much disappointed as embarrassed. A slightly curved back and open eyes. They carry with them a pointed stick and a rubbish bag half full to the brim. As they wait for your response, they prick a metal can and shake it into the bag.

+ "No. Sorry."
ZURAB: "Haven't seen anyone else yet, I'm afraid."
+ "Have you seen anyone else here today?"
ZURAB: "No. Sorry."
-He examines you. 
ZURAB: "Come take a seat. You look weary."
The invitation is as alluring as the seat itself.
You take him up on the offer, grateful even for flimsy shelter from the cold breeze outside.
The man gently careers around the perimeter of the station, pricking cans of steel and plastic wrapping from the ground.
ZURAB: "You've come a long way?"
+ "And then some."
ZURAB: "And still some yet, I'm sure."
+ "Not really."
ZURAB: "Eyes say otherwise."
-He taps the side of the station.
ZURAB: "Seen many of these?"
+ "Too many."
+ "Not enough yet."
- His eyes enquire of yours with a strange sincerity.
ZURAB: "Do you like them?"
+ "Yes."
He smiles.
ZURAB: "So do I."
+ "No."
ZURAB: "Ahh. I'm sorry to hear that."
    ++ "Not their fault. Not yours. Just want to leave them all behind."
    ZURAB: "Understandable.
    ++ "No one's at fault for that.
    ZURAB: "Perhaps the artist is?"
+ "I hadn't thought about it."
ZURAB: "Who could blame you? They're just bus stops."
- His eyes drift to the top of the station. Cracked, weathered paint withers away on the concrete.
ZURAB: "I just hope they remain a little longer than the world that built them. The absurdity. The color. Everything else is falling all around us and everyone else is itching to paint us in black and white and grey and anything but color. But we are red and gold and green and blue and anything and everything."
He smiles.
ZURAB: "I just hope that we outlive the fall. Language, art, music, silly bus stops. That might be all we have against a world that sees us mute and all a wash. I want them to know that we were here, and we were wonderful."
The smile fades to embarrassment, he pricks another can on the ground.
ZURAB: "A fickle fancy. I know.
+ "What isn't?"
ZURAB: "Who can say?"
+ "I understand."
He smiles again.
+ "A little."
ZURAB: "Only a little?"
He chuckles.
- His eyes wander back towards you.
ZURAB: "Play a song with me? Pass some time until the end times?"
+ "Sure."
His smile widens into a childlike grin, and you lose yourselves in the nothingness of fancificul sound. The world becomes more vibrant, color dances on the rooftop. Concrete heals over and grass grows through the morning snow. You think you see a sun behind the sky. For a time, the world is brighter, if only in your minds.
->Them
+ "Haven't the energy." 
ZURAB: Then I'll play for you.
He eyes you from his periphery as he plays. Matching tune to meet your face. But your mind is stuck in questions of where they are. If they're still coming, if waiting is worth the wait. They should be here.
They should.
++They will.->Them

=Them
Footsteps meet the beat of the song, faint crunching of snow in the distance. Your eyes rise instantly to face a silhouette in the light. But this time you know the shape.

You rise.

They run.

They step out from the blinding sun.

You stare.

They stare.

You cry.

They cry.

+ "I'm so fucking cold.

You hold each other till the end times.

The man smiles in the background.

The sound of an engine rumbles round the corner.

You wait together.

You smile together.

You step onto steel platform behind glass doors.

Together.

Of course.

You hold hands.

++No one dares to stop you.
